Privacy Policy
This extension does not collect, transmit, or store any personal information. The only data stored is your printing preferences (selected printers and trays), which is saved locally on your device using Chrome's storage API and is never transmitted elsewhere. The extension accesses your printer information only when you actively choose to print a document, and the PDF files you upload are processed entirely within your browser and are not transmitted to any server.
